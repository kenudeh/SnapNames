# Payments
Use any of the following payment methods to complete transactions on SnapNames:

* **Credit Cards**: You can make payments with the credit card linked to your account or by adding a new card during checkout. <br></br>

* **PayPal**: To pay with PayPal, select it as your preferred payment method when checking out. Ensure you have sufficient funds to cover your purchase before attempting a transaction.<br></br>

* **Funded account**: You can maintain a balance with us if you frequently place backorders or participate in domain name auctions. Funds in your account balance can be applied directly to items in your cart.<br></br>



## Linking a Credit card
To facilitate auto-debiting, when items are in your cart, you must [link](http://example.com) an active credit card to your account. We charge a refundable fee of $1 while linking a card to ascertain the validity of cards added to our system.
<br></br>

## Payment Threshold
We only accept direct bank-to-bank transfers for payments up to $50,000 and above. Please notify us by email before starting a transfer.
<br></br>

## Non-payment and Account Suspension
You must make payments for domain names in your cart within the first five days of their addition. We will suspend your account by 12:00 a.m. Pacific Standard Time (PST) on the sixth day if you fail to clear your cart items.<br></br> 
During a suspension, you can still access your account and make payments. However, we will permanently ban you from using SnapNames if your cart items remain uncleared by 12:00 a.m. on the twelfth day.
