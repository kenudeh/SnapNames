* **PayPal**: Choose PayPal as your preferred payment method at checkout. Ensure your PayPal account has sufficient funds to cover your purchase.<br></br>

* **Funded account**: If you frequently place backorders or participate in auctions, you can maintain a balance with us. Funds in your account can be applied directly to your purchases.<br></br>



## Payment Threshold
For payments of $50,000 or more, we only accept direct bank transfers. Please notify us via email prior to initiating the transfer.
<br></br>

## Non-payment and Account Suspension
Payments for domain names in your cart must be completed within five days. Failure to do so will result in account suspension at 12:00 a.m. Pacific Standard Time (PST) on the sixth day.

While suspended, you can still access your account to make payments. However, if the outstanding items in your cart remain unpaid by 12:00 a.m. on the twelfth day, your account will be permanently banned from using SnapNames.<br></br>
