# Auctions
We offer three types of auctions: private, public, and special. Here are the details of each:

### Private Auction
This is the default auction type for domain names with multiple [backorders](https://curious-druid-05e915.netlify.app/backorders/). Only users who placed a backorder on a domain can participate in its auction.

### Public Auction
Anyone with a verified account can participate in our public auctions. The SnapNames public auction features privately owned and deleted domain names, alongside partner inventories. Auctions for pending delete names can only begin if we successfully register the domain on its deletion date.

### Special Auction
We host special auctions multiple times a year featuring top-quality domain names. If you are looking for an ultra-premium domain, be sure to keep track of these events. Visit our special auctions calendar to find out when the next one is scheduled.

## Auction Duration
An auction can run for a maximum of three days. Any bid received in the last five minutes of an active auction extends the duration by an additional five minutes.
<br></br>

## Minimum Auction Amount
The minimum opening bid for all auctions on SnapNames is $60.<br></br>

## Winning an Auction
The domain name is awarded to the user with the highest bid when the auction concludes. Payment for a winning bid must be made within four days of the auctionâ€™s end.
