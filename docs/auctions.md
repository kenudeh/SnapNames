# Auctions
SnapNames supports three types of auctions to meet the needs of our users.

### Private Auction
This is the default auction type for domain names with more than one backorder. Only users who [placed backorders](http://127.0.0.1:8000/snapnames/backorders/) on a domain name can participate in its auction.

### Public Auction
Anyone with a verified account can participate in our public auctions. The SnapNamesâ€™ public auction consists of privately-owned domain names, pending delete, and partner inventories. Auctions for a pending delete name can only commence if we successfully register the domain name.

### Special Auction
Occasionally, we run special auctions that feature top-quality domain names. If you are searching for an ultra-premium domain name, keep an eye on this one.<br></br>

## Auction Duration
An auction can only run for a maximum of three days. Every bid received in the last five minutes of an active auction extends the duration by five more minutes.<br></br>

## Minimum Auction Amount
The minimum opening bid for all auctions on SnapNames is $60.<br></br>

## Winning an Auction
Any user with the highest bid at the end of an auction wins the domain name. Payment for each completed auction must come in within the first four days after an auction ends. See our [payment methods](http://127.0.0.1:8000/snapnames/payment/) for details on how to make payments on SnapNames.
