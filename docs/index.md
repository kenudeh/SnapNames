Domain names require annual renewal fees. However, when domain registrants, for varying reasons, fail to pay these renewal fees, their domain names end up being deleted by the central registry.

Among the 100,000+ names deleted daily are hidden gems that computer algorithms grab the nanosecond they become available. If you need one of such names, you stand little chance of beating these algorithms - unless you have a more powerful one.

We built SnapNames to help you beat this competition. With our industry-leading technology, you can acquire your dream .com and .net domain names when and if they become available.

## Cost
We charge a fixed fee of $69 for each domain name we snap up. However, domain names with more than one [backorder](http://127.0.0.1:8000/snapnames/backorders/) go into [private auctions](http://127.0.0.1:8000/snapnames/backorders/).


## How to get started
To get started, we recommend you learn about [backorders](http://127.0.0.1:8000/snapnames/backorders/) and how to place one with us.
