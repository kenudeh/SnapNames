Domain names require annual renewal fees, and when registrants fail to pay these fees, their domains expire and enter a “grace period” before being deleted by the central registry.

Every day, thousands of domains are deleted, often including valuable names that are quickly claimed by automated systems. To beat this competition, you need a more powerful tool.

That’s where SnapNames comes in. As an industry pioneer, our advanced technology is designed to give you the edge in acquiring your ideal domain names as soon as they become available. Join millions of other users in securing the perfect domain for your next great idea.

## What's the Cost?
We charge a fixed fee of $69 for successfully acquiring a domain name. If more than one user requests the same domain, it will enter a private auction. You will only be charged if we successfully acquire the domain on the drop date.


## How to get started
To get started, we recommend you learn about [backorders](https://curious-druid-05e915.netlify.app/backorders/) and how to place one with us.
