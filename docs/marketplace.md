# Marketplace
Our marketplace allows verified users to easily buy or sell premium domain names. To help you better understand how our marketplace works, we have divided this section into the following parts:


## Selling
You can sell domain names on SnapNames by either starting an auction or setting a fixed purchase price. All listings are public and visible to the millions of visitors on SnapNames. To list a domain name, follow these steps:

1. Log in or sign up for an account, if you do not have one<br></br> 
2. On the main navigation menu, click **Account > Marketplace > Sell**.<br></br> 
3. Enter the domain name you want to sell in the box provided and add a detailed description, including relevant keywords<br></br> 
4. Select a listing type from the drop-down menu <br></br> 
5. Set a reserve price for auctions, or a fixed purchase price for "Buy It Now (BIN)" listings<br></br> 
6. Click **Publish** at the bottom of the page<br></br> 

We charge a commission of 10% for all marketplace sales. Payouts for sold domains are made within three working days after the completion of the domain transfer to the buyer.



## Buying 
You can acquire domains on SnapNames in two main ways: by purchasing at a fixed "Buy It Now" price or by participating in live and upcoming auctions. Explore both options below:


### Buy It Now (BIN)
Domains with Buy It Now prices are immediately available for purchase at prices set by their owners. To acquire a domain at a BIN price, follow these steps:

1. Enter the domain in the search bar and click **Search**
2. Identify the domain from the search results and click on it. If the domain has a fixed price, a **Buy Now** button will appear at the bottom of the domainâ€™s page
3. Click the **Buy Now** button to add the domain to your cart
4. Enter your payment details to complete the purchase

Depending on the nature of ownership, you can expect to take possession of purchased domains within three working days after we receive your payment.



### Auctions 
We offer three types of auctions: private, public, and special. For detailed explanation of these auction types, see the [auctions page](https://curious-druid-05e915.netlify.app/auctions/).
