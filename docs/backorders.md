# What is a Backorder?
A backorder is a request to register an expired, soon-to-be-deleted domain name on your behalf. At SnapNames, we use a sophisticated algorithm to make multiple registration attempts to the central registry during the deletion window.

The deletion window begins daily at 11:00 a.m. Pacific Standard Time (PST), and lasts for approximately 50 minutes. To successfully place a backorder, we must receive your request at least 30 minutes before the deletion begins.
