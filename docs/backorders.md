# What is a Backorder?
A backorder is a request to register an expired and soon-to-be-deleted domain name on your behalf. At SnapNames, we make this possible with the help of our sophisticated algorithm that makes multiple attempts to register a backorderd domain name during its [deletion window](example.com).

The deletion window is a 50 minutes interval (11:00 a.m. - 11:50 a.m. Pacific Standard Time) during which the [central registry](example.com) releases expired domain names. Therefore, to successfully place a backorder, we must receive your request before the [cut-off](example.com) time.

## How to place a backorder
Now that you know what a backorder is, it is time to start acquiring great domain names from [the drop](example.com). Here is how:

1. Create an account or log into an existing SnapNames account.<br></br>
2. Enter the domain name you want in the search bar and hit "search."<br></br>
3. In the displayed result, identify the domain name and click **Backorder** to add it to your cart.<br></br>
4. Click on the **cart icon** at the top right of the page to check out.


You can add as many names as you want to your cart before checking out.
